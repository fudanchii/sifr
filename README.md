Still Work in Progress

sifr were supposed to be an irc client framework. It's been rewritten and
all skills package was removed. Skill for bot system is planned to be delegated to external scripts.

TODO:
- Reconnect
- Anti-flood
- Bind some dynamic language to enable scripting to change client behavior dynamically.
